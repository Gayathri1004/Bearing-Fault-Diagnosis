# Bearing-Fault-Diagnosis

Experimenting with the Paderborn Dataset to tackle class imbalance in bearing fault classification using cost-sensitive learning to weight fault classes.

## Overview

This project aims to classify bearing faults using vibration data from the Paderborn University Bearing Dataset. The focus is on addressing class imbalance by applying cost-sensitive learning, assigning higher weights to minority fault classes. The approach adapts a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) inspired by prior work with the CWRU dataset.

## Dataset

- Paderborn University Bearing Dataset: Vibration signals from healthy and faulty bearings (artificial and real faults) at 64 kHz sampling rates.
- Classes: Healthy, inner race, outer race, and other faults, with imbalanced sample sizes.

## Status
This project is in the early stages, with experiments planned to implement and test cost-sensitive learning on the Paderborn Dataset.
